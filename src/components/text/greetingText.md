# About me

Hi! I'm Sipeng He(何斯鹏), an undergraduate student from the University of Calgary.

Grown up in Shenzhen, China, I moved to Calgary a year ago and totally fell in love with this city.

I want to become a developer because it is **Super Cool**, and my skills and techniques can help people in many ways.

If you are interested in my projects, or just want to know more about me, please don't hesitate to contact me at:

*sipeng.he@ucalgary.ca*

I can't wait to make new friends!
